- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WNG555!

Electrical Engineer, consultant, photographer.

A man in transition from being left hemisphere dominant.

After personal enlightenment, I have embraced my artistic side. Quality of life is about artistic creativity. 
We've all experienced it, but lost touch with it. Our spirit suffers and turn to ways to compensate. 
We are merely treating the symptoms. The only solution is a cure.
Everything we've been taught and told is wrong. 
It took reaching the third phase of my life to discover this. Some of you are fortunate to have had an epiphany much sooner.

The meaning of life is the journey of understanding our role and place on this fragile planet. 
And how to make each of our days meaningful to the rest of the World, as much as to ourselves.
We have but only this one life to live. Therefore make the most of it now.
